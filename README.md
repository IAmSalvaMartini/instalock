# valorant-insta-lock
This script instant locks characters in the game Valorant.

I created the .exe filwes with pyinstaller. You need both: setup.exe and instalocker.exe! 
First run setup.exe and setup your character order. Then run the instalocker.exe before you want to play Valorant. Choose the character you want to play in the next round and simply press enter. 
When you are in the game, press F6 to lock the character. 

Tipp: 
Valorant has a bug, that you can pick your character at the end of the loading screen in front of the character choose. If you press F6 right then, it works to! 
This bug may be fixed in the next weeks.
